                    <p>You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.
To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.
To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.</p>
<p>At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.
Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.
During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.
These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.
In the end you have to return a final answer using the <code>final_answer</code> tool.</end_code></p>
<h2>Here are a few examples using notional tools:</h2>
<p>Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."</p>
<p>Thought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: <code>document_qa</code> to find the oldest person in the document, then <code>image_generator</code> to generate an image according to the answer.
Code:</p>

Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."</end_code></p>
<p>Thought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.
Code:</p>

<p>Task:
In a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.
What does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?</p>
<p>Thought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.

Observation:
No result found for query "1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein".</end_code></p>

<p>Task: "What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?"</p>
<p>Thought: I will use the tool <code>wiki</code> to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.

</code></pre>
<p><end_code>
Observation:
Pope age: "The pope Francis is currently 88 years old."</end_code></p>
<p>Thought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.
Code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py hljs language-python">pope_current_age = <span class="hljs-number">88</span> ** <span class="hljs-number">0.36</span>
final_answer(pope_current_age)

<p>Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:
- web_search: Performs a web search similar to Google that finds results by matching keywords in your query against web content. Returns a string of the top search results. The returned snippets contain few information, so you are encouraged to use browse tool to get more information.
    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform. The results are found by matching keywords in your query against web content. Use specific keywords for better retrieval.'}}
    Returns an output of type: string
- browse_page: Browse a webpage and extract information relevant to a specific query. You are encouraged to use this tool more to get more information.
    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The complete URL of the webpage.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Specific information you look for from the webpage.'}}
    Returns an output of type: string
- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.
    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}
    Returns an output of type: any</p>
<p>Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:
1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n<code>py' sequence ending with '</code><end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.
2. Use only variables that you have defined!
3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'.
4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.
5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.
6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.
7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.
8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pubchempy', 'xml', 're', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 'bs4', 'time', 'math', 'csv', 'io', 'fractions', 'requests', 'scipy', 'statistics', 'collections', 'itertools', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'pandas', 'chess', 'pydub', 'random', 'unicodedata', 'numpy', 'os', 'json', 'PIL', 'Bio', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'stat', 'pptx', 'torch', 'zipfile']
9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.
10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.</end_code></p>
<p>Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.</p>

Summary: Emily Midkiff's June 2014 <em>Fafnir</em> journal article, "“Dragons are Tricksy”: The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature," examines how children's literature dragons, while often portrayed as cuddly and friendly, retain unsettling aspects from their Germanic origins.  Midkiff argues that traits like a possessive gaze and manipulative speech create an "uncanny" effect, linking them to Freudian concepts.  Despite attempts to soften the dragon image, the article contends that these lingering uncanny qualities maintain the dragon's power and mythic significance in children's literature.</p>

Summary: This MA thesis, "Monstrous Heroism and the Heroic Monster," by Suzanne Swanson (February 2023), examines the roles of monsters in Icelandic medieval literature.  It challenges the conventional view of monsters as simply "other" or liminal beings, arguing that they often possess wisdom and prophetic abilities, aiding heroes. The thesis focuses on three types of monsters: dragons (including Fáfnir), giants (from <em>Grottasǫngr</em>), and revenants (Glámr).  It analyzes how these monsters, in contrast to often ignorant and destructive heroes,  function in narratives, sometimes aligning themselves with divinity. The thesis does not mention Emily Midkiff or a June 2014 journal.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, 'fluffy' nature of dragons in children’s literature."  </li>
<li>"In a short article for Elementary Education, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons."  </li>
<li>"Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain 'real dragons' (129)."  </li>
<li>"She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict."  </li>
<li>"Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a 'real' dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223)."  </li>
<li>"Hope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support the observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott."  </li>
<li>"Shastri performed a content analysis of 151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons have preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children’s literature."  </li>
<li>"She divides picture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure), Wildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien’s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend or a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire, consuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished."  </li>
<li>"After applying these categories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively lost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become tame and meek—especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as opposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77)."  </li>
<li>"Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees with Shastri’s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with some hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales."  </li>
<li>"In total, the work of these scholars over the past two decades indicates that dragons in children’s books are increasingly humorous and less and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago."

The answer <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> the original question appears <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> be <span class="hljs-string">"fluffy"</span> - this was the word quoted <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> both Ruth Stein (<span class="hljs-number">1968</span>) <span class="hljs-built_in">and</span> Margaret Blount (<span class="hljs-number">1974</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> expressing their distaste <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the nature <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> dragon depictions <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> children<span class="hljs-comment">'s literature.</span>

I still need to solve the task I was given:
<pre><code class="language- hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">In</span> Emily Midkiff<span class="hljs-comment">'s June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?</span>

Here is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:
<pre><code class="language- hljs language-rust">Since we already have all the necessary information, I can proceed directly to submitting the <span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> answer. The article shows that Ruth <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">Stein</span> (<span class="hljs-number">1968</span>) and Margaret <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">Blount</span> (<span class="hljs-number">1974</span>) both used the word <span class="hljs-string">"fluffy"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> expressing their distaste <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-variable">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>creasingly cuddly nature of dragons <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> children<span class="hljs-symbol">'s</span> literature.

[PLAN]:
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>. Submit <span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> answer with the word <span class="hljs-string">"fluffy"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> the quoted word used by both authors to express their distaste <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">dragon</span> depictions
